*Ciao!* 👋

::: {.style style="text-align:left;line-height:155%"}

My name is Mauro and I am a PostDoc Researcher at Unibz from Italy. 🇮🇹

My research 🧪 is all about allelopathic phenomena, especially in ancient and modern varieties of barley, from both a chemical and microbiological perspective. The molecules I'm interested in are the two allelochemicals, gramine and hordenine.👨‍🔬

Furthermore, my background encompasses various aspects of 🌱 plant nutrition and physiology, with a special focus on nutritional deficiencies.

I'm a big fan of R and all the possibilities it offers, 🧑‍💻 from data analysis, data visualization, to data publication, and bioinformatics. 📉

I also have a deep love for traditional Irish music and the Irish Gaelic language 🇮🇪, and I enjoy tinkering with electronic components and computers in my free time. 🖥️
