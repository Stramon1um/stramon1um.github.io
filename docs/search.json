    "text": "Allora, non perdiamo tempo!üòä\nSe desiderate comprendere la storia e la cultura dell‚ÄôIrlanda, √® essenziale immergersi nella conoscenza della sua lingua (eh s√¨, √® proprio cos√¨!). La lingua irlandese, il gaelico irlandese, rappresenta un elemento cruciale all‚Äôinterno della famiglia delle lingue celtiche appartenenti alle lingue indoeuropee. Riveste un ruolo di grande importanza nel mantenimento dell‚Äôidentit√† nazionale e contribuisce in modo significativo a definire la cultura irlandese.\nConformemente alla costituzione irlandese, il gaelico √® la prima lingua ufficiale della Repubblica d‚ÄôIrlanda e gode di riconoscimento anche da parte dell‚ÄôUnione Europea. Gli irlandesi lo chiamano comunemente Gaeilge, mentre in inglese viene indicato come Irish. Attualmente, vi sono tre principali dialetti del gaelico moderno, corrispondenti approssimativamente alle regioni del Munster (sud), del Connacht (ovest) e dell‚ÄôUlster (nord). Tuttavia, nonostante ci√≤, l‚Äôinglese √® la lingua pi√π diffusa in Irlanda, principalmente per motivi storici, e solo una piccola ma crescente percentuale della popolazione parla il gaelico come lingua madre o seconda lingua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribuzione linguistica ufficiale come seconda lingua\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribuzione dei Gaeltacht\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunatamente, esistono regioni chiamate An Gaeltacht, situate principalmente lungo la costa occidentale delle contee di Donegal e Galway, come Conemara, le isole Aran, Carraroe, Spiddal e nella penisola di Dingle, nella contea di Kerry, dove il gaelico √® parlato esclusivamente come lingua nativa. In queste zone, considerate vere e proprie isole linguistiche gaeliche, vengono frequentemente organizzati eventi e corsi estivi per coloro che desiderano avvicinarsi alla lingua o per chi vuole approfondirne la conoscenza e migliorare le proprie competenze. Se vi trovate in Irlanda, una visita a questi luoghi √® d‚Äôobbligo, specialmente se nutrite una passione sfrenata per questa meravigliosa lingua!\nAlla prossima!\nSl√°n go f√≥ill!\n\n\n\n Torna in cimaDiritto d'autore¬© 2024 Mauro Maver | Il contenuto di questo blog √® rilasciato sotto licenza CC BY-NC-SA 4.0CitazioneBibTeX@online{maver2024,\n  author = {Maver, Mauro},\n  title = {**Avete un minuto?**},\n  date = {2024-01-22},\n  url = {https://www.mauromaver.eu/posts/posts_ga/un_minuto/},\n  langid = {it}\n}\nPer favore citare questo lavoro come:\nMaver, Mauro. 2024. ‚Äú**Avete un minuto?**.‚Äù January 22,\n2024. https://www.mauromaver.eu/posts/posts_ga/un_minuto/."

    "text": "Benvenuti di nuovo! Come anticipato nel nostro ultimo post, approfondiremo ora il tema delle vocali e della loro pronuncia nella lingua gaelica. Per iniziare, facciamo un breve ripasso:\nVocali\nIn gaelico, le vocali possono essere lunghe o corte, con l‚Äôaccento acuto che indica una vocale lunga (ad esempio, √°). √à importante notare che, simile alle consonanti, la scelta tra una forma lunga e una breve di vocale pu√≤ alterare il significato di una parola. Ad esempio, p√°iste significa bambino, mentre paiste significa ‚Äúpatch‚Äù. Le vocali possono essere distinte come segue:\n\nVocali corte: a, e, i, o, u\nVocali lunghe: √°, √©, √≠, √≥, √∫\n\nPoich√© molte vocali in gaelico sono silenziose e servono solo a indicare la qualit√† delle consonanti (slender o broad), molte parole contengono sequenze di due o tre vocali che rappresentano un unico suono.\nOra, passiamo a una breve descrizione della pronuncia!\nPronuncia delle vocali\n√à importante notare che la pronuncia che seguir√† sar√† solo approssimativa e verranno utilizzate parole inglesi per aiutare a comprendere il suono.\n\n‚Äúa‚Äù in dath suona come in ‚Äúfather‚Äù\n‚Äú√°‚Äù in t√° √® simile a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù\n‚Äúe‚Äù in te si pronuncia come in ‚Äúbed‚Äù\n‚Äú√©‚Äù in m√© ha un suono simile a ‚Äúday‚Äù\n‚Äúi‚Äù in file suona come in ‚Äúfish‚Äù\n‚Äú√≠‚Äù in f√≠rinne √® simile a ‚Äúfear‚Äù\n‚Äúo‚Äù in doras si pronuncia come in ‚Äútough‚Äù\n‚Äú√≥‚Äù in p√≥sta ha un suono simile a ‚Äúboat‚Äù\n‚Äúu‚Äù in fusa suona come in ‚Äúput‚Äù\n‚Äú√∫‚Äù in c√∫r √® simile a ‚Äúdo‚Äù\n\nLe vocali marcate con l‚Äôaccento acuto, chiamate s√≠neadh fada o semplicemente fada, sono lunghe. Ogni vocale seguita da una fada viene pronunciata lunga, influenzando anche la consonante successiva. Ad esempio:\n\ncome ‚Äú√°‚Äù:\n\n‚Äúe√°‚Äù in Se√°n\n‚Äú√°i‚Äù in √°it\n‚Äúe√°i‚Äù in She√°in\n\ncome ‚Äú√©‚Äù:\n\n‚Äú√©a‚Äù in Sh√©amas\n‚Äú√©i‚Äù in c√©im\n\ncome ‚Äú√≠‚Äù:\n\n‚Äúu√≠‚Äù in su√≠\n‚Äúo√≠‚Äù in cro√≠\n‚Äúa√≠‚Äù in sc√©ala√≠\n‚Äúu√≠‚Äù in bu√≠\n‚Äúu√≠o‚Äù in bu√≠ochas\n\ncome ‚Äú√≥‚Äù:\n\n‚Äú√≥i‚Äù in br√≥ige\n\ncome ‚Äú√∫‚Äù:\n\n‚Äú√∫i‚Äù in c√∫is\n‚Äúi√∫‚Äù in si√∫l\n‚Äúi√∫i‚Äù in ci√∫in\n\n\nInoltre, alcune sequenze di vocali non accentate rappresentano automaticamente vocali lunghe. Ad esempio:\n\nLe vocali seguite da ‚Äún‚Äù, ‚Äúnn‚Äù, ‚Äúll‚Äù, ‚Äúrr‚Äù, ‚Äúrd‚Äù, e ‚Äúm‚Äù sono pronunciate lunghe, come in crann, ard, tinn, ecc.\n‚Äúae(i)‚Äù √® pronunciato come ‚Äú√©‚Äù, ad esempio traein\n‚ÄúAo‚Äù e ‚Äúaoi‚Äù sono pronunciati come ‚Äú√≠‚Äù, come in naoi\n‚Äúeo(i)‚Äù √® pronunciato come ‚Äú√≥‚Äù, ad esempio ceo\n\nAlcune sequenze di vocali sono invece pronunciate come vocali corte. Per esempio:\n\n‚Äúea‚Äù, ‚Äúeai‚Äù e ‚Äúai‚Äù all‚Äôinizio di una parola sono solitamente pronunciati come ‚Äúa‚Äù, come in bean, fear, seaic√©ad, aisteach\n\nInfine, alcune regole extra:\n\n‚Äúai‚Äù dopo una consonante si pronuncia come ‚Äúa‚Äù, come in bainis, cail√≠n\n‚Äúio‚Äù si pronuncia come ‚Äúi‚Äù, come in fios\n‚Äúoi‚Äù si pronuncia come ‚Äúe(i)‚Äù, come in toil, oiread\n‚Äúui‚Äù si pronuncia come ‚Äúi‚Äù, come in uisce, fuil\n‚Äúiu‚Äù si pronuncia come ‚Äúu‚Äù, come in fliuch\n\nQueste sono solo alcune delle regole di pronuncia delle vocali in gaelico. Tuttavia, √® importante tenere presente che ci sono molte altre regole, alcune delle quali pi√π complesse, che possono variare da dialetto a dialetto. Le regole qui descritte sono solo una guida generale e la tua comprensione della pronuncia migliorer√† sicuramente con la pratica e l‚Äôascolto di risorse audio. Inoltre, parlare con madrelingua irlandesi o con chi conosce bene la lingua pu√≤ migliorare notevolmente la tua pronuncia.\nCome sempre, la pronuncia pu√≤ essere una delle sfide pi√π difficili, ma una volta padroneggiata, il resto del tuo viaggio nell‚Äôapprendimento del gaelico sar√† pi√π agevole!\nAlla prossima!\nSl√°n go f√≥ill!"

    "title": "Mutazioni I: la Lenizione",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dopo aver introdotto l‚Äôalfabeto gaelico, ci addentriamo ora nella vera grammatica. Oggi analizzeremo le famose lenizioni. Per completezza, il termine gaelico per lenizioni √® s√©imh√≠u.\nDetto questo, possiamo cominciare!\nLe mutazioni, caratteristiche di tutte le lingue celtiche, modificano il suono di una parola in determinati contesti. Possono essere causate da una particolare parola o particella, da una specifica struttura grammaticale o da una combinazione delle due. Per lo pi√π, le mutazioni coinvolgono le consonanti, anche se vi sono cambiamenti anche nelle vocali. √à importante precisare che non tutte le consonanti sono soggette a mutazione.\nLa mutazione pi√π comune √® la lenizione, che coinvolge nove consonanti in una vasta gamma di situazioni. Questa mutazione si manifesta con l‚Äôaggiunta di una ‚Äúh‚Äù dopo la prima consonante della parola. Ecco l‚Äôelenco delle consonanti interessate dalla lenizione:\n\nb -&gt; bh b√°n/bh√°n\nc -&gt; ch c√≥ta/ch√≥ta\nd -&gt; dh dubh/dhubh\nf -&gt; fh fuinneog/fhuinneog\ng -&gt; gh gaoth/ghaoth\nm -&gt; mh m√°thair/mh√°thair\np -&gt; ph p√≥ca/ph√≥ca\ns -&gt; sh sagart/shagart\nt -&gt; th teach/theach\n\nCome potete vedere, √® facilmente riconoscibile dalla ‚Äúh‚Äù subito dopo la prima consonante. Inoltre, le consonanti residue (h, l, n, r) non subiscono la mutazione. Ora elencher√≤ alcuni dei contesti in cui √® necessario utilizzare le lenizioni:\n\nPer caratterizzare il verbo in una frase (ad esempio, per renderlo al passato):\n\nTit m√© Io cado -&gt; Thit m√© Io caddi\n\nPer negare il verbo:\n\nFeic m√© Io vedo -&gt; N√≠ fheic m√© Io non vedo\n\nPer indicare il genere di un nome (maschile o femminile):\n\nan crann l‚Äôalbero an chlann la famiglia\n\nNei casi di un aggettivo di un nome femminile:\n\nl√° maith buon giorno o√≠che mhaith buona notte\n\nIn caso di particolari situazioni, come numeri, aggettivi possessivi, preposizioni:\n\nteach amh√°in una casa -&gt; tr√≠ theach tre case\na carr la sua (di lei) macchina -&gt; a charr la sua (di lui) macchina\nag Gear√≥id a Gear√≥id -&gt; √≥ Gear√≥id da Gear√≥id\n\n\nNel corso del blog, ne incontreremo molti altri!\nIn alcuni casi, vi √® un blocco delle lenizioni. Questo avviene quando la ‚Äús‚Äù (sia larga che stretta) √® seguita da una consonante come p, t, c, f, m. Perci√≤ in questi casi, non si aggiunge la ‚Äúh‚Äù, anche se la situazione lo richiede. Ecco alcuni esempi:\n\nan scian mhaith il coltello buono -&gt; anche se il nome √® femminile (si intuisce dall‚Äôaggettivo ‚Äúmaith = buono‚Äù che ha la ‚Äúh‚Äù), il nome resta immutato a causa della presenza di ‚Äúc‚Äù dopo la ‚Äús‚Äù iniziale;\ntr√≠ sciorta tre gonne -&gt; anche se il nome segue il numero ‚Äútr√≠ = tre‚Äù, resta immutato a causa, ancora una volta, della ‚Äúc‚Äù dopo la ‚Äús‚Äù iniziale.\n\nInoltre, non si verifica mutazione se le parole dopo l‚Äôarticolo ‚Äúan‚Äù, equivalente a ‚Äúthe‚Äù in inglese, iniziano per t, d, s, anche se le altre consonanti sono mutate. Esempi:\n\nan bhean bheag la piccola donna\nan t√≠r bheag la piccola terra\nan ghloine mh√≥r la grande vetrata\nan deoch mh√≥r il grande drink\n\nCome potete vedere, nonostante i nomi siano femminili (t√≠r e deoch, come si nota dalla mutazione sull‚Äôaggettivo), il nome resta immutato perch√© inizia con ‚Äút‚Äù e ‚Äúd‚Äù e segue l‚Äôarticolo ‚Äúan‚Äù. Altre parole che evitano la mutazione di t, d, s sono c√©ad ‚Äúprimo‚Äù e agus ‚Äúe‚Äù.\nAlla prossima!\nSl√°n go f√≥ill!\n\n\n\n Torna in cimaDiritto d'autore¬© 2024 Mauro Maver | Il contenuto di questo blog √® rilasciato sotto licenza CC BY-NC-SA 4.0CitazioneBibTeX@online{maver2024,\n  author = {Maver, Mauro},\n  title = {**Mutazioni I: la Lenizione**},\n  date = {2024-03-13},\n  url = {https://www.mauromaver.eu/posts/posts_ga/mutazioni_I/},\n  langid = {it}\n}\nPer favore citare questo lavoro come:\nMaver, Mauro. 2024. ‚Äú**Mutazioni I: la Lenizione**.‚Äù March\n13, 2024. https://www.mauromaver.eu/posts/posts_ga/mutazioni_I/."

Questa mutazione √® riconoscibile dal fatto che le consonanti vengono precedute da una determinata consonante (specifica per ogni consonante) e inoltre si genera una nuova pronuncia della parola mutata.

    "title": "Independent effects of drought and cultivation systems on wheat: insights from the trait space concept",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The urgent need to understand and explore deeper into plants‚Äô responses to drought is driven by the increasing global warming and the resulting decrease in predicted water availability for crops. Despite the extensive research on the correlation between crops and water1, there is still a lack of studies focusing on the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC). Such studies are fundamental in understanding the physiological responses of crops to water scarcity, thus protecting their growth and productivity2,3.\n\nStudies on plant trait space are particularly lacking. The concept of trait space was created to integrate multiple traits from an integrative perspective. This includes a range of traits such as root water uptake depths, stem length and anatomy, and foliar ecophysiology. However, existing studies in this regard have primarily focused on growth and yield or relationships between individual traits without offering a comprehensive evaluation of the traits within a SPAC context. Specifically, our understanding of how multiple crop traits respond simultaneously to varying water availability is still insufficient.\nTo address this challenge, Sun et al.4 conducted an experiment examining the trait space resulting from the interaction between crop systems, management, and drought in winter wheat. Both conventional and organic cultivation methods were evaluated, applying intensive and conservative soil tillage. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), being a principal source of calories worldwide5, was chosen as the case study.\nThis study represents the first attempt to simultaneously evaluate water and vegetative traits in wheat within a SPAC context and to relate these traits to yield in response to drought and the cultivation system. In general, the data obtained from this experiment show how drought and the cultivation system independently influence traits in wheat, specifically indicating that changing the cultivation method (from conventional to organic) is not a valid and effective strategy for adapting crops to climate change.\nWhen considered individually, the authors observed significant effects of the cultivation system on vegetative traits such as chlorophyll content, plant height, leaf area, and yield. These traits are strongly correlated with the nutritional status of the plants, mainly related to nitrogen (N)6. These findings are consistent with previous studies and are most likely due to the different chemical and structural properties of the soil resulting from the different cultivation systems applied. For example, wheat was fertilised with a high N-availability fertiliser in the conventional system, while cattle slurry was applied in the organic system. However, no effects of the cultivation system on water traits were observed, especially under water stress. This suggests that crop management has a limited impact on water regulation in wheat.\nThe drought factor affected wheat and its yield in different ways, regardless of the cultivation system. Besides water traits, drought also significantly impacted vegetative traits, consequently leading to a reduction in yield7. These effects were observed across all applied cultivation systems.\nWith this study, the authors have, for the first time, evaluated the trait space of wheat in SPAC, attempting to integrate root water uptake, xylem transport, leaf water status, and vegetative traits. The data analysis revealed an evident alteration of the trait space induced by drought, reflecting differences between the conventional and organic systems in terms of water, vegetative traits, and yields. Interestingly, no differences were observed between intensive and conservative tillage, nor was there any interaction between the cultivation system and drought. These findings underline that drought-induced changes were independent of the cultivation system, which raises strong concerns about the expectation to alleviate drought stress of winter wheat by selecting different, widely common management practices, such as organic farming and conservation tillage.\nIn summary, Sun et al. have demonstrated how both the cultivation system and drought independently affect traits in wheat. They also highlighted the usefulness of the trait space concept in assessing the effectiveness of future agricultural strategies in adapting cultivation systems to climate change. However, further investigation of the complex interactions between traits and cultural systems remains necessary to develop more sustainable and resilient agricultural management systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nSun, Q., Gilgen, A.K., Wittwer, R., von Arx, G., van der Heijden, M.G.A., Klaus, V.H. & Buchmann, N.

    "title": "Plant-mediated soil effects on microbiota in plant-herbivore systems",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Soil has a significant impact on plants, profoundly influencing their microbiota. Studies have demonstrated that the influence of soil far exceeds that of other factors, such as plant genotype or the presence of insects1,2. Indeed, soil microorganisms can colonise different parts of plants, like roots and leaves, affecting their microbiome or altering their physiological status. Overall, these soil-mediated effects are known as soil-driven effects. Similarly, the presence of herbivores can directly or indirectly influence plant microbiomes, known as herbivore-driven effects. However, few studies have explored the combined impact of soil- and herbivore-driven effects on the structure and diversity of microbial communities within plants.\n\nTwo possible mechanisms are hypothesised to explain the interactions between below- and above-ground microorganisms in a plant-herbivore system. The first mechanism involves direct mediation by the plant itself. For example, microorganisms can interact directly with the host plant or indirectly by improving the availability of nutritional resources. Alternatively, influence can occur via spillover, with direct transfer of microorganisms between above- and below-ground compartments, such as through insect frass or honeydew, or vice versa through splashes or droplets of water (e.g., rain or irrigation).\nThis study by Malacrin√≤ & Bennett3 aims to clarify how microorganisms in a plant-herbivore system influence each other. They hypothesised that the plant itself primarily mediates the effects of soil and herbivores on plant microbiota. The experimental design included manipulating the soil composition (three different inocula), the presence/absence of herbivorous insects, and the effect of the presence/absence of soil cover.\nThe experiment was conducted on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grown in microcosms with three different soil microbial communities (agricultural field, marginal field, and prairie) selected for their distinct compositions. Half of the microcosms were covered with a neoprene disc at the soil level to separate ‚Äúvia plant‚Äù effects from ‚Äúvia spillover‚Äù effects, and half of them were exposed to the herbivore Manduca sexta. At the end of the experiment (7 weeks), microbial communities of soil, rhizosphere, root, leaf, and herbivores were analysed, along with plant and insect biomass.\nThe results of this study primarily show that soil inoculum has the most significant impact on the structure of bacterial communities in all plant compartments analysed, especially on root and herbivore microbiota. Additionally, it was interesting to note that changes induced by soil inoculum on herbivore microbiomes followed a linear gradient, with the greatest impact observed by agricultural soil and the least by prairie soil.\nHowever, contrary to previous studies, it was observed that the soil-driven effect influences the leaf and herbivore microbiota regardless of the presence of the neoprene disc. These results thus support the hypothesis of a soil-driven effect ‚Äúvia plant.‚Äù This effect could be due to changes in plant metabolism and physiology, which in turn alter the diet of herbivores and their microbiome. Another possible explanation is the direct transfer of microorganisms from below ground to above ground via the xylem, as demonstrated by recent research4. Furthermore, it was observed that soil microbial communities can negatively affect insect biomass. This factor is particularly interesting as it could lead to the development of more sustainable methods for controlling pathogens5,6.\nOn the other hand, the herbivore-driven effect can alter plant microbiome composition both directly and indirectly through changes in metabolism, plant physiology, and root exudates7. Moreover, the data support the presence of microbial spillover between different plant compartments, although it is reduced when the soil is covered. This indicates that microbial spillover and plant-mediated changes in the below-ground microbiota could coexist in this specific system.\nIn conclusion, the study by Malacrin√≤ & Bennett demonstrates that the soil-driven effect on plant and herbivore microbial communities is mediated by the plant, not via spillover. At the same time, it was observed that the rhizosphere and root microbiota are influenced by microbial spillover from herbivores. These findings provide a clearer understanding of the interactions between soil, plants, and herbivores, with potential applications in improving agricultural practices by manipulating soil microbiota.\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nMalacrin√≤ A. & Bennett A.E.

    "title": "Modulation of lettuce responses to salinity by Graminaceae-derived protein hydrolysates",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The increasing salinisation of soil is a major challenge for modern agriculture, as it significantly and irreversibly reduces crop yields. Many studies are currently focusing on this problem, anticipating a continuous worsening mainly by climate change. Indeed, it is projected that by 2050, half of the world‚Äôs arable land will be unusable due to high salinity1.\n\nPlants, particularly vegetables, are highly susceptible to salinity, which significantly affects their growth and productivity. Consequently, over the course of their evolution, plants have developed defence mechanisms and strategies, making them more adaptable and resilient under stressful conditions. Among the main defence responses include the modulation of phytohormones, the production of osmoprotectants, and antioxidant enzymes.\nHowever, in cases of severe salinity, these endogenous responses activated by the plant may not be enough to support growth. In such conditions, external interventions, such as the application of plant biostimulants (PBs) derived from food waste or agricultural residues, could provide an effective and sustainable solution. Among PBs, protein hydrolysates (PHs) are particularly promising; composed of a mix of polypeptides, oligopeptides, and amino acids, their composition varies based on the protein source, thus determining their effects on the plant2. A recent study demonstrated that PHs from Graminaceae induce diverse effects in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) under saline stress, although the contribution of individual fractions remains unclear3. Lettuce, widely cultivated globally for its high nutritional value, is highly sensitive to salinity and is often used as a model plant in these studies.\nIn this context, Monterisi et al.4 investigate the molecular effects of PHs derived from Graminaceae (P) and their light fraction F3 (&lt;1 kDa) on lettuce under saline stress conditions using a combined transcriptomic and metabolomic approach. In this experiment, lettuce plants were exposed to two levels of salinity, 0 mM and 30 mM NaCl. P and F3 treatments were applied via spray on a weekly basis, starting from the 10th day after transplanting (DAT); control plants received distilled water. Upon reaching commercial maturity (44 DAT), the plants were sampled and subsequently analysed using different approaches.\nThe results confirmed that the efficacy and mode of action of PHs strongly depend on the physiological status of the plant and the composition (fractionated and non-fractionated) of the biostimulants. In general, the authors demonstrated that both treatments, P and F3, significantly modulate the transcriptome and metabolomic profile of lettuce under saline stress, albeit through distinct mechanisms. For instance, P treatment resulted in the up-regulation of genes involved in biosynthesis and remodelling of the cell wall, cellulose hydrolysis, organic acid biosynthesis, osmoprotectant production, and antioxidants. On the other hand, F3 treatment showed a positive modulation in response to ethylene (via ERF) and genes involved in the MAPK signalling pathway, highlighting a regulation of salinity response mechanisms5.\nAnother interesting aspect concerns the P treatment. It was observed that P up-regulates 17 genes encoding different nucleosome components. These changes can influence the degree of chromatin condensation, making it more or less accessible to transcription factors. Abiotic stresses have already been shown to activate these epigenetic mechanisms in plants6, but this is the first time it has been observed for PHs in stressed plants.\nFrom a multi-omics perspective, the integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed that both P and F3 trigger a significant hormonal response under saline stress conditions. Among the main regulated phytohormones and respective pathways are ethylene, abscisic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids. The latter, in particular, play an important role in plants in counteracting the negative effects of salinity by promoting cell division and elongation7.\nIn the absence of saline stress, the data obtained are partially discordant with those present in the scientific literature. Indeed, both P and F3 exhibited a down-regulation of genes involved in different steps of the photosynthetic process. Although these data are consistent with the biochemical parameters recorded in the experiment, they contrast with previous studies that demonstrated the positive effects of PHs on the photosynthetic machinery.\nIn conclusion, Monterisi et al. demonstrate that PHs derived from Graminaceae and their molecular fractions can significantly modulate the molecular, biochemical, and physiological responses of lettuce under saline stress. Although P and F3 activate different mechanisms, both treatments provide benefits in counteracting severe salinity conditions. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating the bioactivity of the molecular components of biostimulants to fully maximise their potential in agricultural practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nMonterisi, S., Zhang, L., Garcia-Perez, P., Alzate Zuluaga, M.Y., Ciriello, M., El-Nakhel, C., Buffagni, V., Cardarelli, M., Colla, G., Rouphael, Y., Cesco, S., Lucini, L. & Pii, Y.

    "title": "Role of ExAD in salt-induced directional root response in Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Most plants are sensitive to salinity, which negatively impacts root growth and development, making saline stress one of the primary causes of crop yield losses. The primary cause of this stress is sodium chloride (NaCl), which affects the plant in two ways: by causing osmotic stress, thereby inhibiting water uptake by the roots, and by causing high ion accumulation in tissues1,2. At the root level, the presence of NaCl leads to alterations in root architecture and cell wall composition and inhibits gravitropism. Plants can modify the direction of root growth to avoid areas of high soil salinity, a process known as halotropism (negative halotropism)3.\n\nThe mechanism underlying halotropism has been recently studied and demonstrated, involving a redistribution of the phytohormone auxin in the root4. However, under uniform salt conditions, little is known about the regulatory pathways and genetic components involved in salt-induced directional root growth. To address this, Zou et al.5 used the variation in root growth direction under salinity as a phenotypic marker to investigate root responses to salinity and salt-signalling pathways.\nFor this study, the authors initially developed a novel dynamic salt-induced tilting assay (SITA) to investigate and monitor root growth direction in response to salinity and salt-induced inhibition of gravitropism. Four-day-old Arabidopsis thaliana plants were transferred to plates with different treatments (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 200 mM sorbitol, and control) and then rotated 90¬∞ clockwise to apply gravistimulus. Upon transfer, the root tip direction (RTD) was monitored every 20 minutes for at least 24 hours. This experiment revealed that changes in root bending via RTD were significant only in the presence of NaCl and not with other osmolites (KCl and sorbitol), although all impacted root growth. Similar results were obtained by applying NaNO3, confirming that the presence of Na+ ions alone, not osmotic stress, is sufficient to trigger a different root growth direction in the SITA system.\nGiven this Na+ specificity, the authors subsequently used it in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) as a phenotypic marker to identify new factors involved in the salt-dependent root bending response in the presence of gravistimulation. This experiment screened the salt-specific response of 345 natural accessions of A.thaliana using the SITA system for possible correlations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This analysis identified a genetic locus in a region of chromosome 3 encoding for a cell wall-modifying enzyme, EXTENSIN ARABINOSE DEFICIENT TRANSFERASE (ExAD). This arabinosyltransferase adds the fourth arabinofuranose (Hyp-Araf1-4) to an adjacent hydroxyproline (Hyp) residue on extensins. Extensins are Hyp-rich glycoproteins necessary for maintaining the primary architecture of the cell wall6.\nThe functionalities of ExAD in regulating root growth direction were further characterised using the SITA system on two previously characterised T-DNA knock-out mutant lines: exad1-1 and exad1-37. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the roots of exad1 (loss-of-function) mutants exhibited thickening of the root epidermal cell walls and increased cell wall porosity under saline conditions. This phenotype is likely linked to the lack of Hyp-arabinosylation of extensins. Additionally, the roots exhibited altered gravitropic root bending and a reduced salt-avoidance response. These findings suggest that the arabinosylation of extensins constitutes another type of cell wall modification that, while not strictly necessary for normal root growth, is crucial for directional response under salt stress.\nIn summary, the study by Zou et al. showed that saline stress significantly impacts the composition and structure of the cell wall. ExAD plays a crucial role in these changes, as it is involved in cell wall modification and is necessary for modulating root growth direction under saline stress in A.thaliana. However, ExAD is not the only factor involved, and its possible interactions with other salt-induced signals and factors remain to be established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nZou Y., Gigli-Bisceglia N., van Zelm E., Kokkinopoulou P., Julkowska M.M, Besten M., Nguyen T.-P, Li H., Lamers J., de Zeeuw T., Dongus J.A., Zeng Y., Cheng Y., Koevoets I.T., J√∏rgensen B., Giesbers M., Vroom J., Ketelaar T., Petersen B.L., Engelsdorf T., Sprakel J., Zhang Y. & Testerink C.

    "title": "Enhanced photosynthesis in rice with far-red light supplement: unveiling dual roles beyond shade avoidance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Light represents the primary source of energy for plants. Plants have developed elaborate strategies to maximise light exposure throughout their long evolution. This need is particularly crucial in environments with high vegetation density, where competition for light can be intense.\n\nIn photosynthesis, the light spectrum between 400-700 nm is fundamental, while light between 700-800 nm, known as far-red (FR), contributes to photosynthesis only under specific conditions (e.g., Emerson effect)1. FR light is mainly known for its role as a signal indicating the presence of nearby vegetation. Nearby plants reflect FR light while absorbing red light, thus decreasing the Red:FR (R:FR) ratio. This reduction signals the proximity of other plants, triggering the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). SAS induces changes in plant architecture, such as internode elongation, at the expense of forming new leaves and branches. Rice (Oryza sativa), one of the most important crops, is known for its sensitivity to high vegetation density and low light, although its response to SAS and to the R:FR ratio is still poorly studied.\nA study by Huber et al.2 examined the effect of supplemental FR light on architecture, growth, and the photosynthetic process in seven rice varieties. The plants were grown in a greenhouse under control conditions with white light (WL with R:FR 2.0), while the treatment involved supplemental FR light (WL + FR, R:FR 0.2). Analysis of the rice architecture revealed that plants exposed to FR exhibited an increase in leaves and tillers compared to those grown only in WL. This effect varied among the different rice varieties studied. However, no significant differences were observed in terms of height and internode length, indicating a weak SAS response and a promotion of vegetative growth.\nFollowing transcriptome analysis in 5-day-old seedlings, only a small number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from FR were common among all rice varieties. Specifically, only one gene (LOC_Os09g27750), which encodes an ethylene‚Äêforming enzyme, was identified in all the varieties analysed. Subsequent Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that all genes regulated by FR, although limited in number, were primarily involved in photosynthetic processes and localised at the chloroplast level. Overall, the impact of FR on gene regulation was limited to specific physiological processes.\nDespite the weak SAS response in rice, a key aspect of the study was the effect of FR light on biomass accumulation and photosynthesis. The results showed that plants exposed to FR light had a higher rate of leaf formation, increased total leaf area, and more tillers, leading to a significant increase in root and shoot biomass. This effect was further confirmed with FR pulse treatments at the end of the light cycle (15 min WL + EoD FR) to further trigger SAS. In this case, a reduction in tillers and leaves was observed, suggesting that WL + FR can indeed promote growth and development in rice.\nTo better understand the role of FR in promoting biomass accumulation and plant development, the authors focused on investigating the effects of FR light on photosynthesis. They found that supplemental FR light did not significantly alter stomatal density or chlorophyll content. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation was significantly increased only in plants exposed to WL + FR, with some varieties showing almost double the fixation compared to the control. Additionally, no effects on stomatal conductance were observed, suggesting that FR can increase photosynthesis without causing greater water loss through transpiration, contrary to blue and red photons3,4.\nThis study by Huber et al. demonstrated that FR light not only acts as a shade/proximity signal but also as an energy source for photosynthesis and biomass accumulation, consistent with other studies5,6. WL + FR significantly increased growth and photosynthetic processes in rice without activating a noticeable SAS response. This suggests that rice may rely on other light signals (such as blue or red light) or chemical signals (e.g., volatile organic compounds) to sense the density of surrounding vegetation. Furthermore, the weak SAS response in rice may have been overshadowed by the strong promotion provided by the FR supplement.\nIn conclusion, the interaction between FR and the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in photosynthesis needs further investigation, especially to understand how FR can compensate for a reduction in PPFD, particularly in the lower canopy zones7. These results are particularly relevant for optimising light in greenhouse and vertical farming systems, where controlling light quality and quantity is crucial for maximising plant growth and productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nHuber, M., de Boer, H.J., Romanowski, A., van Veen, H., Buti, S., Kahlon, P.S. et al.¬†(2024).

When temperatures exceed this range, plants activate heat-stress responses (HSR) to adapt to these stressful conditions. These adaptation and response strategies involve various developmental processes in the plant1. Heat triggers the HSR through heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcription factors, which induce the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), helping the plant adapt to heat. Additionally, the HSR involves several phytohormone pathways, with abscisic acid (ABA) playing a crucial role in regulating the plant‚Äôs water status, promoting thermotolerance, and enhancing plant acclimation2,3.\n\nTo better understand the mechanisms of temperature perception and the induction of thermotolerance, Bohn et al.4 examined different lines of Arabidopsis thaliana that were hyper-responsive or insensitive to ABA under heat stress. Among all the mutants tested, one showed strong thermosensitivity, and the gene locus was subsequently named THERMO-WITH-ABA-RESPONSE 1 (TWA1). Expressed throughout the plant, it encodes a predicted intrinsically disordered protein of 130 kDa with two potential ethylene-responsive-element-binding-factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs (LxLxL).\nIn a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, TWA1 was found to interact with JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED MYC-LIKE 2 (JAM2), a transcription factor involved in jasmonate (JA) hormone signalling5,6, and with the co-repressors TOPLESS (TPL) and TOPLESS-RELATED (TPR), forming a repressor complex. However, this interaction is highly temperature-dependent. Specifically, TWA1 only accumulates in nuclear subdomains at elevated temperatures (e.g.¬†30-35¬∞C), and its conformational changes allow physical interaction with JAM2 and TPL/TPR. These temperature-dependent structural rearrangements are mediated by a 20 amino acid sequence in the amino-terminal region of TWA1, defined as the Highly Variable Region (HVR). The HVR thus confers strong thermosensitivity to TWA1.\nHomologues of TWA1 have been identified in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. An interesting aspect is the role of HVR in thermal sensing, particularly its amino acid sequence. Although they have comparable inhibitory effects at 30-35¬∞C, their thermal sensitivity or temperature threshold varies. For instance, half-maximum inhibitory values (IT50) of 20¬∞C, 26¬∞C, and 30¬∞C were observed for TWA1 in A.lyrata (cold acclimated), A.thaliana, and Sinapis alba (Mediterranean climate), respectively. Similarly, this threshold has been shown to affect accumulation and interaction with JAM2 and TPL and, consequently, the activation of its inhibitor effects.\nMoreover, tests involving the overexpression of TWA1 (TWA1(oe)) have demonstrated its ability to confer an enhanced thermotolerance, both basal and acquired, without impacting growth and photosynthesis. No significant differences in growth, photosynthesis, and gas exchange were observed between WT and TWA1(oe) when grown at 20¬∞C. These findings reconfirm the activation of TWA1 only above specific temperatures. Additionally, the improved thermotolerance of TWA1 is not due to the constitutive upregulation of HSP transcripts.\nTWA1 presents an interesting parallel with other known thermal sensors, such as EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) in A.thaliana7. However, thermally, TWA1 acts oppositely to ELF3, repressing gene expression at high temperatures and being much more sensitive to temperature changes.\nIn conclusion, Bohn et al. have identified a new thermosensor, TWA1, and demonstrated its requirement for thermotolerance and the transcriptional upregulation of HSFA2 and HSPs in A.thaliana. The potential of TWA1 in breeding and biotechnology is vast, providing valuable tools for enhancing crop acclimation to the growing issue of global warming. Additionally, TWA1 and its orthologues represent a valuable resource in the emerging field of thermogenetics8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nBohn L., Huang J., Weidig S., Yang Z., Heidersberger C., Genty B., Falter-Braun P., Christmann A. & Grill E.

    "title": "Repressive role of GLK in vindoline and TIA pathway regulation in Catharanthus roseus",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The plant Catharanthus roseus is of significant scientific interest because it is the primary and only source for the biosynthesis of the two terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs), vinblastine and vincristine, which are widely used in chemotherapy treatments. A distinctive feature of TIAs and the vindoline pathway (one of the downstream TIA pathways) is their strong accumulation in developing leaves, followed by their decrease as the leaf matures1. However, despite the biosynthetic pathway being extensively characterised2, the exact regulatory mechanisms underlying this developmental pattern remain largely unexplored.\n\nRecently3, two transcription factors (TF) involved in regulating the vindoline pathway have been identified: CrPIF1, acting as a repressor in dark conditions and CrGATA1, acting as an activator in the presence of light. Alongside GATAs, GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) is a TF known in plants for its key role in chloroplast biogenesis in young shoots and developing leaves. In fact, when etiolated shoots are exposed to light, GLK activates genes for chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast maturation. However, its expression is inhibited in mature leaves.\nIn this context, Cole-Osborn et al.4 investigated the potential role of the transcription factor GLK in the developmental activation of TIA biosynthesis, particularly vindoline biosynthesis, based on the similarity in leaf-level regulation between GLK and the vindoline pathway.\nThe authors identified a single GLK homolog in C.roseus. Although many plants possess two GLK proteins, previous studies have shown that all C4 plants and only some C3 plants have two GLKs. C.roseus is a C3 plant, and these results are thus consistent with the literature5. Additionally, multiple GLK binding motifs were identified in many vindoline pathway promoters, supporting the hypothesis that CrGLK could indeed modulate their expression.\nHowever, although GLK was initially hypothesised to act as an activator, experiments demonstrated quite the opposite. In the first experiment, the expression of CrGLK, the vindoline pathway, and some TIA genes were monitored in leaves at different developmental stages (immature and mature leaves) and light intensities (low and moderate light). In general, vindoline/TIA pathway genes were more highly expressed in immature leaves and moderate light. On the other hand, CrGLK was more highly expressed in mature and low light conditions. This negative correlation, although preliminary, would support the hypothesis of CrGLK as a non-activator of the vindoline pathway.\nTo functionally characterise CrGLK, the authors used the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technique to silence CrGLK, applying the same conditions as the previous experiment. As a positive control for the successful silencing of CrGLK, the expression of CrLHCB2.2, known to be strongly activated by GLKs6, was monitored. The CrGLK-silenced plants exhibited a clear phenotype, with pale green leaves and lower chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents. This phenotype is consistent with that shown by double mutants glk1 glk2 in Arabidopsis thaliana, reconfirming the presence of a single copy of GLK in C.roseus and its positive correlation with chlorophyll accumulation. Furthermore, the silencing of CrGLK led to increased expression of vindoline and TIA pathway genes (except for the D4H gene); this effect was particularly evident under moderate light conditions and in immature leaves, under which GLK expression is normally high.\nSimilarly to the VIGS silencing, the authors studied the effects of two chemicals, Norflurazon (Nor) and Lincomycin (Lin), capable of inducing chloroplast retrograde signalling, strongly repressing GLK and LHCB2.2, and disrupting chloroplast development. From this experiment, it was observed that treatment with Lin induced repression of CrGLK, CrLHCB2.2, and D4H while strongly inducing vindoline/TIA pathway genes. These results and those obtained with VIGS suggest that CrGLK does not activate but instead may repress TIA biosynthesis. Interestingly, Nor did not have the same effects as Lin, indicating that simply reducing CrGLK is not sufficient, and other mechanisms may be involved.\nIn conclusion, Cole-Osborn et al. identified and functionally characterised the single GLK homolog in C.roseus and observed its negative correlation with regulating vindoline and TIA pathway expression genes. These findings suggest a repressive rather than an activating role for CrGLK, providing new insights into the regulation of this important metabolic pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nCole‚ÄêOsborn L.F., McCallan S.A., Prifti O., Abu R., Sjoelund V. & Lee‚ÄêParsons C.W.T.

    "title": "Enhancing root-knot nematode invasion resistance in clover through root uptake of benzoxazinoids",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The evolution of plants has led to the development of complex defensive strategies based on metabolites, specifically secondary metabolites. Plants often co-evolved in biodiversity-rich environments, developing mechanisms to exploit metabolites released by other plants for their own defence. This phenomenon underpins co-cropping, where two crops grow in the same space, allowing chemical interaction between plants through metabolite release1. In this context, one plant acts as the donor while the other as the target, with metabolites influencing growth, pathogen defence, and shaping rhizosphere communities.\n\nAmong these metabolites are benzoxazinoids (BXs), a class of compounds primarily found in Poaceae, which play crucial roles in the rhizosphere, such as soil pathogen defence and allelopathic effects2. An underexplored aspect is the uptake of BXs by plants that are naturally lacking and whether this can enhance their pathogen resistance. A relevant example is clover (Trifolium spp.), an important legume in many inter-cropping systems for its nitrogen-fixing ability. However, clover is also an excellent host for root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.)3,4.\nIn this context, Hama et al.5 investigated the uptake, transformation, and translocation of BXs, and how they influenced nematode resistance in white clover (Trifolium repens L.). Exposed to different BXs to facilitate absorption, clover plants were subsequently transferred to BXs-free soil. This soil was then inoculated with 2‚Äì7 day-old infective juveniles (J2 stage) of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Plants were sampled at 0, 3, 5.5, and 8 weeks post-transfer, analysing BXs concentrations and nematode invasion rates over time. The experiments were designed to separate the timing and location of BXs exposure from nematode infestation to prevent any direct effects of BXs on the nematodes.\nThe experiments demonstrated that clover could absorb and translocate the applied BXs to its leaves. Additionally, clover showed the ability to metabolise them, an example being the glycosylation of DIBOA into DIBOA-glc, a detoxification and storage mechanism common in BX-producing plants6 but not previously observed in clover. However, by 5.5 weeks post-transfer, no BXs were detected, suggesting that without continuous exposure, BXs concentrations in clover diminish until undetectable.\nA key aspect of the study was the effect of BXs on nematode invasion. The authors observed that exposure to BXs significantly reduced nematode invasion. At 3 weeks post-transfer, all tested BXs showed a significant reduction in nematode invasion compared to the control, with the greatest reduction observed for HBOA (-68%). However, the effect diminished over time, with a significant reduction in invasion rate at 5.5 weeks only for DIBOA and no difference at 8 weeks. This decline in nematode suppression mirrors the reduction in concentrations of BXs in the roots, as clover cannot naturally synthesise them.\nThis study is the first to show that the uptake of defence metabolites by other plant species can significantly improve pathogen resistance. Although nematode invasion in clover was notably reduced up to 5.5 weeks after the last BXs exposure, the effect diminished without continuous supply. This suggests that in a co-cropping context, the continuous release of BXs by producing plants like wheat or rye could maintain sufficient levels of these compounds in the soil, extending the protective effect in clover.\nHama et al. study advances our understanding of plant interactions in co-cropping systems. It demonstrated that secondary metabolites such as BXs can be transferred from one plant to another, enhancing pathogen resistance. However, this effect is temporary and tied to the ongoing availability of BXs in the soil.\nThese findings suggest that intercropping with BX-producing plants could effectively improve pathogen resistance while reducing pesticide use. Further field studies are necessary to fully evaluate the long-term benefits and drawbacks of these interactions and develop optimal agricultural practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nHama, J.R., Fomsgaard, I.S., Topaloviƒá, O., & Vesterg√•rd, M.

    "title": "13C dynamics in forest rhizosphere microbial communities under drought and rewetting",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Global climate change is causing a series of severe weather events like prolonged droughts followed by heavy rainfalls, posing a growing threat to forest ecosystems worldwide. Understanding the crucial link between plants and rhizosphere microbial communities during drought periods is fundamental, as it significantly influences soil community structure and functionalities, with carbon (C) transport and release by plants into the rhizosphere playing a key role.\n\nIn this context, Gao et al.1 investigated the impact of drought and soil rewetting on forest rhizosphere microbial communities. The study was conducted on 4-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests under artificial conditions and approximately 120-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests under natural growth conditions. The authors applied a combination of isotopic labelling techniques with 13C and molecular analyses to trace the flow of C initially absorbed by plants, subsequently released into the soil, and then incorporated by microbial communities. 13C labelling was performed at the leaf level during drought and two weeks after rewetting. These data were compared with those obtained from the control treatment, consisting of constantly irrigated plants. This approach allowed them to explore in detail the mechanisms regulating rhizosphere microbial community dynamics in response to drought and rewetting events in two different forests.\nDuring drought, a significant reduction in 13C uptake was observed in both forest types at both plant and soil microbial community levels. This phenomenon has been previously observed in grasslands2,3; however, this experiment showed a significant decrease in symbiotic fungi, particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) (biomarker 18:2œâ6,9). This decline could compromise water and nutrient availability for plants, thereby affecting their growth and ability to withstand strong water stress, further exacerbating their stress status. Among the less negatively affected microorganisms were gram-positive bacteria, which have a thicker peptidoglycan membrane and are therefore more drought resistant.\nMoreover, at the cellular level, the authors observed a shift in the functional use of 13C absorbed by microbial communities. Indeed, during drought, there was a significant decrease in 13C incorporated into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) compared to microbial cytoplasm (CFE-microbial biomass). This would indicate a greater priority towards energy conservation, osmoregulation, and storage processes, at the expense of cell growth. PLFAs are the main components of cell membranes, and their reduced presence would indicate a modulation in the use of fresh root exudates released by plants into survival and adaptation strategies rather than development4.\nUpon restoration of optimal soil moisture conditions, both in beech and pine, microbial communities demonstrated remarkable resilience and recovery from the severe drought experienced. One of the main explanations for this strong resilience lies in the rapid restoration of tree C allocation in the rhizosphere at the end of the drought. One of the most interesting aspects observed was a greater incorporation of 13C into microbes, compared to the control, despite normal leaf 13C uptake values. This implies a preferential transfer and incorporation towards rhizosphere communities, strengthening their role in plant functioning and maintaining forest ecosystem health5,6.\nIn addition, this study highlighted differences between beech and pine forests in the response of microbial communities to drought and subsequent rewetting. Beech forests showed more pronounced effects, with greater sensitivity to drought and a more pronounced response to rewetting. Conversely, in pine, the effect of rewetting had a lesser impact, perhaps due to the long-term adaptation of microbial communities to repeated natural drought events. Overall, these results may have been influenced by both the experimental conditions applied (more drastic and artificial in the case of beech) and the different sizes and biomass of the plants. The examined pine plants had more biomass (greater height) and consequently greater C storage. This would allow them to have greater buffering capacity in case of C content, transport, and release changes compared to beech, for example, under adverse growth conditions.\nIn conclusion, the study conducted by Gao et al. provides important insights into the complex interactions between plants and soil microbial communities during drought and soil moisture restoration periods. The results obtained also offer valuable tools for understanding the mechanisms underlying the resilience of forest ecosystems, which are increasingly subject to rapid climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nGao, D., Luster, J., Z√ºrcher, A., Arend, M., Bai, E., Gessler, A., Rigling, A., Schaub, M., Hartmann, M., Werner, R.A., Joseph, J., Poll, C. & Hagedorn, F.

    "title": "Impact of intraspecific chemodiversity on growth and reproduction in Tanacetum vulgare",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Phenotypic diversity within species represents a crucial element in ecological dynamics, influencing the performance of individual organisms within communities and ecosystems. Functional traits play a fundamental role in the various factors contributing to this diversity. These are measurable attributes at the individual level that reflect the presence of specific environmental conditions, thereby impacting ecosystem functioning1. In addition to visible morphological traits such as growth, reproduction, or physiology, there are less evident traits such as the composition of plant metabolites2. Defined as chemodiversity, and recently the focus of increasing interest in ecological studies, it plays a critical role in species and community interactions within ecosystems.\n\nOrganisms of the same species can be categorised into chemotypes based on their primary chemical compounds, the composition of volatile and non-volatile mixtures, or specific synthesised metabolites3. Plants like Tanacetum vulgare, known for their high intraspecific variation in specialised metabolites, are often used as model plants to study the effects of these metabolites on intra- and interspecific interactions4. However, few studies have focused on the effects of manipulating chemodiversity on plant-plant interactions5.\nTo test different hypotheses, Ojeda-Prieto et al.6 carefully set up an experimental design to manipulate chemotype richness (number of chemotypes at plot level) and the presence of specific chemotypes at the level of individual plots, assessing their effects on growth, reproductive traits, and headspace volatile release. Individual plots (each with six plants) were created and differentiated in terms of chemotype richness, ranging from 1, 2, 3, to 6 chemotypes. Subsequently, the plots were combined into six blocks (14 plots each), each containing specific combinations of plot-level chemotype richness. All T.vulgare plants were propagated via stem cuttings to maintain the same chemotype as much as possible within each individual plant.\nThe initial data collected in the study of T.vulgare revealed a complex interaction between the chemotypes. Indeed, the different chemotypes used exhibited differences in growth parameters (number of stems and plant height) and reproductive traits (number of flowers and floral phenology). These results align with previous studies7,8, confirming that propagating by stem cuttings maintains the phenotypic traits of the chemotypes. In particular, morphological differences between chemotypes tend to decrease over time, suggesting distinctive growth strategies and adaptations for individual survival in the early stages of development.\nContrary to expectations, no significant differences were observed in the growth parameters of plants grown in plots with different levels of chemotype-richness. This indicates that, when it comes to intraspecific competition, chemotype diversity may not exert a direct or sufficient impact on growth traits. It also suggests that the chemotypes are adaptable and robust in various environments.\nHowever, there were significant effects on reproductive traits, with differentiated floral strategies among chemotypes in response to plot-level chemodiversity. This strategy could serve to minimise competition for pollination and maximise reproductive fitness. Additionally, variation in floral phenology among different chemotypes might represent a mechanism to avoid cross-pollination and optimise seed production9.\nAnother interesting aspect is that at the plot level, the individual contribution of each chemotype tends to become less pronounced over time, suggesting a convergence of morphological traits and making the plots increasingly similar. Furthermore, no overyielding effect was observed in plots with greater chemodiversity; instead, an opposite trend was recorded. These observations suggest that chemodiversity may not necessarily lead to higher overall productivity at the plot level, possibly due to the presence of complex, competitive dynamics.\nFinally, at the plot level, the effect of increasing chemotype richness was evident in leaf-level terpenoid profiles. Surprisingly, contrary to expectations, the same trend was not observed regarding plot-level headspace volatile terpenoid profiles, highlighting the presence and influence of variables and factors that still need to be better understood and studied.\nOverall, this study by Ojeda-Prieto et al. underscores the importance and impact of intraspecific chemodiversity on plant growth and reproduction dynamics. Specifically, the results highlight how it can fundamentally influence various ecosystem functions, such as primary productivity, resource use efficiency, ecosystem stability and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nOjeda‚ÄêPrieto, L., Medina‚Äêvan Berkum, P., Unsicker, S.

    "title": "Redefining tinnitus: a complex neurological disorder and its genetic roots",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When was the last time you heard nothing, just silence? What a strange question to ask, you might be thinking. My answer might differ from yours, when I was 16. I suffer from tinnitus, continuous ‚Äúringing noises‚Äù in both of my ears, and my loyal companion for more than 20 years now.\n\nThe definition of tinnitus is precisely the phantom sensation of ‚Äúringing in the ears‚Äù or, in other words, the perception of noise in the absence of external acoustic stimulation. Despite being experienced by more than 15 % of the world‚Äôs population, it does not have a cure. The only solutions for those who suffer from it are limited to reducing their psychological distress or masking the symptoms by external sound sources. Still, there are no targeted treatments for the pathophysiological mechanisms1.\nTinnitus can be continuous, pulsatile, or episodic, affecting one or both ears. It can last only a few moments, months, years, or a lifetime. Severe tinnitus is a debilitating condition experienced by 1% of the population, and it has been discovered to have a significant heritability2,3.\nEnvironmental factors were thought to be the main drivers of tinnitus for decades, but the widespread availability of sequencing data from distinct cohorts has opened new research possibilities4. The first study that defined tinnitus as a complex disorder in which genes and environmental factors interact was conducted by Clifford et al.5, performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using large datasets from self-reported tinnitus. The following year, Wells et al.6, with a case-control GWAS, identified RCOR1 (REST COREPRESSOR 1 ) as the gene with the highest significance in a sub-group of patients with the most severe form of tinnitus. Nevertheless, even though both analyses of GWAS used UK Biobank participants, there was little overlap in the strongest associations between both studies, possibly because of the significant heterogeneity in tinnitus phenotype4.\nGWAS allows the identification of significant common variants with small effect sizes that confer susceptibility to tinnitus. However, Amanat et al.7 used a different approach to identify the enrichment of rare pathogenic variants and target candidate genes. This strategy consisted of selecting individuals with extreme clinical attributes, toxic effects, or extreme responses to treatments, i.e., extreme phenotype8, to narrow the phenotypic heterogeneity that tinnitus manifests.\nAmanat et al.7 aimed to identify rare variants in synaptic genes by exome sequencing of Spanish patients with M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease and an extreme tinnitus phenotype, performing a gene burden analysis (GBA). The disease of M√©ni√®re is a rare ear disorder characterized by intense episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss9. After years of the disease, patients consider tinnitus the most debilitating symptom10,11.\nTheir research uncovered a burden of rare missense and structural variants in several synaptic genes. Three candidate genes, ANK2 (ANKYRIN-2 ), TSC2 (TSC COMPLEX SUBUNIT 2 ), and AKAP9 (A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 9 ), were replicated in a Swedish cohort of patients with severe tinnitus. Moreover, to determine if the association of these genes was specific to severe tinnitus, they performed a GBA using an independent cohort of patients with generalized genetic epilepsy who did not have tinnitus. Some neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, could also share some common genetic background with tinnitus. None of the genes showed significant enrichment of missense variants, confirming the tinnitus-specificity of the candidate genes.\nGene ontology and gene-set enrichment analysis uncovered the involvement of membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal protein binding in neurons. ANK2, TSC2, and AKAP9 are associated with axonal branching and neuron connectivity in the brain, and their expression in spiral ganglion neurons was confirmed. Furthermore, ANK2 and TSC2 showed significant co-expression in limbic brain regions.\nThis study presents several limitations, such as a lack of representation of the whole phenotype of M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease using the extreme phenotype strategy or the possibility that other neural pathways unrelated to synapses are also implicated in tinnitus. Nevertheless, it provides a first reference point in understanding the molecular players in severe tinnitus, and it could be a significant step forward in its future treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\n1.

    "title": "Floral synchrony: the role of FLOWERING LOCUS T in the leaf-specific vernalisation response in Arabidopsis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The synchronisation of flowering is important for plants as it helps them to reproduce efficiently and adapt to their environment. One key mechanism regulating this synchrony is vernalisation, where plants are induced to flower after being exposed to low temperatures for a long time. However, it is not fully understood how vernalisation helps plants belonging to heterogenous populations to synchronize their flowering.\n\n\n\n\nThe present study conducted by Huang et al.1 aims to investigate how the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT ) gene affects the regulation of floral synchrony in Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on its impact in response to vernalisation. Through a series of experiments, the researchers examined the role of genes involved in the flowering process and evaluated the importance of what they call ‚Äúleaf-specific vernalisation response‚Äù in its regulation. The study hypothesised that leaves may have a ‚Äúcold memory‚Äù that differs depending on their developmental stage at the onset of vernalisation.\nThe experiments were conducted on the Col-FRI genotype of A. thaliana, which was obtained by introgressing the FRIGIDA locus (FRI ) into Col, thus making its flowering vernalisation-dependent. In the first experiment, Col-FRI seeds were germinated sequentially (cohorts on different days preceding vernalisation induction), grown under controlled light and temperature conditions (SD, 8 weeks of vernalisation at 4¬∞C and LD until flowering), and their flowering time was recorded. It was observed that the Col-FRI genotype showed synchronised flowering (positive synchronisation index (SI)2) among different groups despite germination occurring at distinct times. In contrast, Col showed asynchronous flowering among the various groups, exhibiting a negative SI.\nReplicating prior experiments investigating the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC ) gene3, a repressor of FT, the authors analysed the expression levels of the latter in relation to the leaf-specific vernalisation response. Again, using sequential germination experiments of Col-FRI, it emerged that FT expression was not strictly correlated with the number of leaves present at the time of flowering but rather with a specific number of leaves which developed after vernalisation induction. This confirms the presence of an intricate flowering regulation mechanism based on leaf number and their developmental stage at the onset of low temperatures.\nTo minimise the possible effect of photoperiod on FT expression level analyses, the authors applied SD photoperiod both before and after vernalisation. This allowed the confirmation of the FLC expression values reported in the literature3 (elevated in the absence and before vernalisation) while simultaneously observing uniform FT expression values in leaves developed during and after vernalisation. These data indicate that FLC and FT expression levels are not positively (or negatively) correlated. Furthermore, this suggests that the relationship between leaf development and vernalisation is more evident and marked for FT compared to FLC.\nIn addition to FT and FLC, the authors evaluated the expression levels of five other genes involved in flowering pathways: FLM, TSF, MAF3, SOC1, and AGL19. Leaf-specific vernalisation response was also observed for these genes, although with different and gene-specific expression patterns. Among all the genes analysed, only FLC and SOC1 showed diametrically opposite expression patterns. For the remaining genes, a strong effect of leaf-specific vernalisation response was observed. In fact, higher expression levels were found in leaves developed during and after vernalisation.\nFinally, the researchers assessed the impact of leaf-specific vernalisation response compared to other regulatory processes, such as those deriving from the shoot apical meristem (SAM). In a last experiment of Col-FRI sequential germination, they established a MD photoperiod following the eight weeks of vernalisation and monitored FT levels until flowering. Data showed an FT expression pattern similar to that observed in the presence of post-vernalisation LD conditions, but with an intensity almost five times lower. Contrary to the low FT levels, the delay in flowering was slight and not significantly prolonged. This suggests that other non-leaf-dependent signals may play a significant role in regulating flowering in response to vernalisation.\nThe study conducted by Huang et al. represents one of the first attempts to establish a clearer relationship between flowering pathways and flowering synchrony in response to vernalisation. In Arabidopsis, the authors observed a correlation between leaf-specific vernalisation response and floral synchrony, although this does not represent the only factor at play. Other non-leaf-based signals, such as those generated by the shoot apical meristem, could play an important role as well. Another key factor emerging from this study was the lack of correlation between FLC and FT expression levels, despite the former acting as a strong repressor of FT.\nOverall, the research conducted in Arabidopsis by Huang et al. contributes to a better understanding of leaf-level interaction between vernalisation and floral synchrony, paving the way for further investigations in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\nüëâ Click here for the PDF üëà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article\nHuang, P-K., Schmitt, J. & Runcie, D.E.

Oggi concluderemo la nostra serie sulle mutazioni irlandesi esaminando i prefissi h- e t-.\n\nPrefisso h-\nQuando una parola inizia per vocale e segue determinate particelle che terminano per vocale, una h- √® aggiunta come prefisso alla seconda parola, separando le due vocali con la pronuncia e la scrittura. Ecco alcuni esempi:\n\nan oifig (l‚Äôufficio) -&gt; na hoifig√≠ (gli uffici)\nbean √°lainn (bella donna) -&gt; t√° s√≠ go h√°lainn (lei √® bella)\n\nQueste particelle non hanno effetto sulle parole che iniziano per consonanti e non causano lenizioni o eclipsis.\n\n\nPrefisso t- (per consonanti)\nLa consonante s, sia larga che stretta, √® affetta da questa mutazione. In molti casi, dove la lenizione √® richiesta ma √® bloccata per la presenza della consonante n prima della parola, la s sar√† prefissata da una t, che ne cambier√† la pronuncia. Questa mutazione √® frequente nei nomi genitivi maschili e nei nomi non genitivi femminili:\n\nan siopa (il negozio) -&gt; doras an tsiopa (la porta del negozio)\nan sagart (il prete) -&gt; teach an tsagairt (la casa del prete)\n\nLa t- non viene aggiunta se la s iniziale √® seguita da una di queste consonanti: c, t, p, m, f.\n\n\nPrefisso t- (per vocali)\nIn questo caso, la t √® separata dalla parola per mezzo di un trattino. Questa mutazione ha effetto solo sui nomi singolari maschili dopo l‚Äôarticolo an:\n\nathair (padre) -&gt; an t-athair (il padre)\nuisce (acqua) -&gt; an t-uisce (l‚Äôacqua)\nim (burro) -&gt; an t-im (il burro)\nairgead (argento/denaro) -&gt; an t-airgead (l‚Äôargento/il denaro)\n\nQuesta mutazione non si applica ai nomi genitivi maschili e a tutti i nomi femminili.\nEcco quindi un‚Äôintroduzione ai prefissi h- e t- nelle mutazioni irlandesi.
