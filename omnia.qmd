## Omnia *Focus*

### Volume I -- 22 July 2024

*Omnia* is an independent, multidisciplinary, open-access journal dedicated to enhancing the communication of science-related topics.

The *Focus* section has been created to distil the main highlights of featured research articles into concise summaries of 700-800 words (or one A4 page in the current layout). This approach aims to make scientific language more accessible, provide readers with a clear overview, and encourage them to explore the original articles more deeply.

In this first Volume (July 2024), a collection of research highlights primarily related to the macro category of plants is presented. The highlights are available as blog posts and in a convenient printable format (PDF).

*Editor: Mauro Maver*

<!-- Omnia is an independent, multidisciplinary, open-access journal through which I aim to enhance my ability to describe, narrate, and disseminate science-related topics. To this end, I created the Focus section to summarise and condense the main highlights of these articles, making the scientific language more accessible, all within a maximum of 700-800 words (or one A4 page in the current layout). This provides readers with an overview and encourages them, if interested, to read the original article in full. -->

<!-- Omnia Focus aims to make scientific findings more accessible by summarizing the main highlights of articles like ours. I appreciate their efforts in disseminating our work and encourage you to read and explore the topic further. -->
